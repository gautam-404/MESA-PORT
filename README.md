* Now create, run and share your MESA projects!
  - You only need to share your python project. Anyone who has Python and MESA installed, will then be able to run your model using only python code. You can also run MESA solely through this module.
* This package also allows you to create and remove parameters from your inlist files. [Courtesy of [Marco MÃ¼llner](https://github.com/MarcoMuellner/PyMesaHandler)]
